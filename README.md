# Calculus and Python

## Motivation
I am starting the last course in a unified treatment of Calculus at a local community college. My learning process includes reading each chapter twice, creating notes, and solving end-of-section problems. As the difficulty of the problems increases at the end of each section, having the solution manual is helpful, but some problems require more exploration. The goal of this repository is to promote an experimental mindset when applying Calculus and Python.

## How to Use
The comments in the code will contain the relevant Calculus concepts for easy reference and clarity. Use other resources to learn the underlying Calculus concepts.
