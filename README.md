## Motivation
I am starting the last course in a unified treatment of Calculus at a local community college. My learning process includes reading each chapter twice, creating notes, and solving end-of-section problems. End-of-Section problems increase in difficulty where having the solution manual is neccessary. But some problems don't have the solution or require more exploration. The goal of this repository is to promote an experimental mindset when applying Calculus and Python with the help of chatbots. 

## How to use
The comments in the code will contain the relevant Calculus concepts for easy reference and clarity. But please use other resources to learn the underlying Calculus concepts fully. 

## Notation and Style
Solutions are given in a way that makes sense to me and will closely follow the textbook and solution manual. Theorems, collolaries, formulas, etc. will consider textbook notation and style above all else.
