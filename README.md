# Calculus and Python

## Motivation
I am starting the last course in a unified treatment of Calculus at a local Community College. My learning process includes: reading each chapter twice, make notes, and complete the homework problems at the end of each section. At the end of each section, problem difficulty increases. Having the solution manual helps but some problems need more exploration. The goal is to promote an experiemntal mindset when applying Calculus and Python. 

## How to use
The comments will contain the Calculus concept for easy reference and clarity. Use other resources (like your textbook!) to learn the underlying Calculus concept.
